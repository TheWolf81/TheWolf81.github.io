## Overview

Shop Mate is a mobile application designed to simplify grocery shopping. Whether you're managing a personal shopping list or coordinating with family and friends, Shop Mate ensures you never forget an item again.

## Motivation

The idea for Shop Mate was born out of a common frustration: losing or forgetting paper shopping lists. By creating a mobile solution, I aimed to make shopping list management more convenient and collaborative. Additionally, switching to a digital format helps reduce paper waste, benefiting both the environment and your budget.

## Preparation

Before diving into development, I outlined the key features and functionality I wanted to include in Shop Mate. This planning stage was crucial for ensuring a smooth development process and a user-friendly end product.

Using [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) as a "notepad", this was the last state of the list of items I had for backend / frontend functionalities (without the inevitable extras).

 I also considered the technologies I would use to build the app, opting for Flutter for the frontend which I found could be a great choice for this project due to its cross-platform capabilities. As I had no prior knowledge on Flutter I started by following a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), more specifically, the one by Angela Yu, which you can find [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart). For the backend, I chose Node.js and Express, as I was already familiar with these technologies and knew they would be well-suited for the task at hand.

## Architecture and Technologies

Built with Flutter, Shop Mate features a seamless and intuitive mobile experience. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with a Postgres database for data storage. Authentication is handled through a username-password login, ensuring secure access to corresponding shopping lists and authorized actions.

For state management, the frontend relies on the provider package, while API calls are managed using the http package. On the backend, Express serves as the web framework, bcrypt handles password hashing, and Kysely simplifies database migrations and queries. Kysely was a pleasant discovery in this project, as it was simple enough to use and worked perfectly for this use case. You can learn more about Kysely [here](https://kysely.dev/).

## Database Schema
The database schema for Shop Mate is structured to support efficient data organization and user management:

## Features

Shop Mate offers a variety of features to streamline shopping list management:

- User authentication with an unique username and a password
- "Keep me logged in" functionality
- Account deletion
- Creation, editing, and deletion of shopping lists
- Adding and removing items from lists
- Marking items as purchased and clearing marked items
- Sharing lists with other users
- Managing user permissions for shared lists

Rather than just reading about these features, see them in action in the video below:

## Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to explore mobile app development and learn more about Flutter. I enjoyed the challenge of creating a user-friendly UI and implementing features in a mobile environment. While I had prior experience with backend technologies, this project allowed me to refresh on those skills while also exploring new tools like Kysely, making the experience both rewarding and insightful.

In the future, some features could be added to shop mate, such as:

- Notifications for shared lists
- Adding users as an invite instead of a direct share
- Requesting access to a shared list

For now, I'm happy with the current state of Shop Mate and these features may never be implemented, but they rest here for future reference.

Shop Mate has been distributed to a select group via an executable APK file. In response to user needs, I've also developed a Portuguese UI, ensuring adaptability across devices based on language settings. This lays a foundation for easy integration of multiple languages in the future. I don't plan to release it on the Google Play Store, but I'm open to sharing the app with others who are interested in trying it out. If you'd like to test Shop Mate, feel free to reach out to me!
