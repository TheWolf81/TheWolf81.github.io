## Overview

Shop Mate is a mobile application designed to simplify grocery shopping. Whether you're managing a personal shopping list or coordinating with family and friends, Shop Mate ensures you never forget an item again.

## Motivation

The idea for Shop Mate was born out of a common frustrationâ€”losing or forgetting paper shopping lists. By creating a mobile solution, I aimed to make list management more convenient and collaborative. Additionally, switching to a digital format helps reduce paper waste, benefiting both the environment and your budget.

## Architecture and Technologies

Built with Flutter, Shop Mate features a seamless and intuitive mobile experience. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with a Postgres database for data storage. Authentication is handled through a username-password system, ensuring secure access.

For state management, the frontend relies on the provider package, while API calls are managed using the http package. On the backend, Express serves as the web framework, bcrypt handles password hashing, and Kysely simplifies database migrations and queries. You can learn more about Kysely [here](https://kysely.dev/).

## Database Schema
The database schema for Shop Mate is structured to support efficient data organization and user management:

## Features

Shop Mate offers a variety of features to streamline shopping list management:

- User authentication with an unique username and a password
- "Keep me logged in" functionality
- Account deletion
- Creation, editing, and deletion of shopping lists
- Adding and removing items from lists
- Marking items as purchased and clearing marked items
- Sharing lists with other users
- Managing user permissions for shared lists

Rather than just reading about these features, see them in action in the video below:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <iframe width="315" height="560"

      frameborder="0" 
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
      allowfullscreen
      style="border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden;">
  </iframe>
</div>

I'm hoping it shows how Shop Mate can help you stay organized and efficient while shopping!

## Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to explore mobile app development and learn more about Flutter. I enjoyed the challenge of creating a user-friendly UI and implementing features in a mobile environment. 

In the future, some features could be added to shop mate, such as:

- Notifications for shared lists
- Adding users as an invite instead of a direct share
- Requesting access to a shared list

For now, I'm happy with the current state of Shop Mate and these features may never be implemented, but they rest here for future reference.

Shop Mate has been distributed to a small group of people as an executable APK file. I don't plan to release it on the Google Play Store, but I'm open to sharing the app with others who are interested in trying it out. If you'd like to test Shop Mate, feel free to reach out to me!
