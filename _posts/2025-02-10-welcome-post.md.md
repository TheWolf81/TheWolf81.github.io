# Welcome to my personal blog

I'm so excited to start this journey and share my projects with you. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

I'm a software engineer with an interest in IoT, critical systems and web related stuff. I love working on projects that involve physical devices, the real-time aspect of applications and the challenges of building reliable systems. I'm also passionate about motorcycling. I started riding at 19 years old and nowadays, whenever I have free time, travelling on my motorcycle is my go-to escape. In the future I hope I can learn more about these machines so I can use my free time to become a mechanic hobbyist.

In the next posts, I look forward to sharing my personal projects and the lessons I've learned from them, as well as some insights on the technologies I come along and other topics that I find interesting.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions. I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities to learn.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A special thanks to Cotes Chung for creating the [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) theme, which I'm using for this blog.
