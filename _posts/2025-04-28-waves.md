## Overview
Waves is a local music player for Android, built entirely in Kotlin. It’s designed for users who prefer listening to their own music collection without the noise of ads or the complexity of modern streaming apps.

## Motivation
The idea behind Waves came from frustration. Most music players I found on the Play Store were cluttered, ad-heavy, or overloaded with features I didn’t need. I wanted something lightweight and focused — just a clean, reliable way to play the music already on my phone. While Xiaomi’s stock player felt bloated, I remembered Huawei’s simpler app from a previous phone and wanted to build something in that spirit.

In an age dominated by streaming services and cheap mobile data, local music players have largely faded into the background. With Waves, I wanted to revive that nostalgic experience — the simplicity of listening to music stored on your own device, free from ads, subscriptions, or internet dependencies. Beyond that, this project was also a chance to learn more about Android development and Kotlin, making it the perfect blend of personal interest and technical growth.

## Architecture and Technologies
Unlike my previous project, Shop Mate, I jumped into Waves without much planning — it was a dive into Android and Kotlin development from scratch. That approach turned out to be more challenging than expected. Looking back, learning the basics beforehand would have saved me a lot of time and refactoring.

I began by watching YouTube tutorials to understand how Android activities work and how to populate them with data. In terms of technologies, I kept it minimal but practical:

In the end, in terms of technologies, I ended up using only Kotlin and a few libraries:
 * MediaStore: to access the local music library
 * MediaPlayer: to play the music
 * AudioManager: to manage audio focus (to avoid playing music when another app is already playing)
 * MediaSession: to manage audio playback and control the media session with notifications and other devices

## Features
Waves includes the essentials you'd expect from a local music player:

 * Browse and play music stored on your device
 * Create and manage custom playlists
 * Control playback (play, pause, skip, shuffle, repeat) within the app, via the notification bar, or through connected devices like headphones
 * Enjoy seamless background playback while using other apps

Here’s a gallery showcasing the app’s interface and functionality:

## Conclusion
Working on Waves taught me a lot — not just about Kotlin and Android, but also about the importance of planning. Jumping in headfirst meant learning through mistakes, which made the process slower but also more insightful. I had to rethink parts of the code more than once, but in doing so, I developed a deeper understanding of how Android apps are structured.

In the end, I’m proud of what I built. Waves is simple, purposeful, and does exactly what I need. It’s now my go-to music player, especially during travel or when I just want to disconnect and enjoy my own collection. If you’re someone who values simplicity over streaming, I hope Waves works for you too.
